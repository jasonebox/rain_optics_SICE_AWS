* DONE get plus minus average snowline change quantity, like using a standard d from the multi-image sample OR use the plus minus from the emergent bare ice threshold, see lines 370+ in rain_optics_SICE_AWS/SICE_retrievals/albedo_elevation_profile_082021_cw_nw_ne.py and update the values in the google doc

* TODO add revised Sentinelhub code to repo outputs geotiff and has graphic with map rotated so north is up, grid axis off, site labled
* DONE for e.g. 20 August, overplot a symbol and name using in rain_optics_SICE_AWS/SentinelHub/sentinel_hub_plt.py the position of KAN_U, and may be KAN_M is on there using the lositions from rain_optics_SICE_AWS/AWS_info/PROMICE_GC-Net_info.csv

* PROCESSING examine Sentinel-2 images for blue saturated snow in ~August 2020 and 2019, how different is 2021?
* DONE obtain surface elevations corresponding with  67.009100, -47.301900
  output of get_elevation_at_point.py -> Elevation at -47.3019, 67.0091: 1756.0
